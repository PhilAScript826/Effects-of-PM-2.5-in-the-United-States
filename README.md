# Effects of PM2.5 in the United-States

This project analyzes CDC data that monitors Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 in the United States and tries to identify a correlation with Asthma. The study is to determine the likelyhood of an individual visiting the emergency room for Asthma related systems depending on the level of PM2.5 in the individual's given state: The following information is used for this analysis:

- Population data
- PM2.5 levels
- Emergency room visitation statistics for Asthma

The correlation is not a new one, but it provides insight to those unfamiliar to the issue.
